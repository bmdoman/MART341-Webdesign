1. The difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans is what they are attributed to in terms of the blocks that are being used to build your website. The classes group elements together and make it easier to figure out what things are related to each other. The ids are what identify each of the groups of items. Each id has a unique identifier whereas a class can have multiple similar identifiers. a div is what groups the ids and classes together. A span is similar to a div but it is used within a div, they are used to find things that need to be unique.

2. The advantage of using a hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo to host videos is it makes it easier to post things that are larger or take up more space. This would be advantages when trying to post a movie or some other very large file that the host website you are using does not have such large file types easily postable. The disadvantages are that sometimes the link does not work properly or you are using a website and driving traffic to them as well. It is sometimes hard to figure out how to work things between websites.

3. A challenges that I had this week was just figuring out how to add all of the elements. There were a lot of little things that I had to remember to add and not forget the little details of the code. I just would go over things and make sure that they work. I also would check my code frequently and make sure everything looked right on the webpage.
