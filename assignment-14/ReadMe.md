1. I choose Bulma. I choose it because I liked the style of it the best and I thought it was pretty easy to use.

2. I used a CDN because it was easier than uploading a ton of different files onto a website or css page.

3. HTML5 changed the web because it made it easier to put videos and multimedia on webpages without using an outside source. It also made it easier to draw shapes on canvases and use images better.

4. I ran into some troubles with what exactly the CSS frameworks were. It took some digging and research to figure out what they do and how they work. This assignment was very hard for me and gave me a lot of roadblocks. I do not know how java script works and how to integrate it into my assignment. I had a very hard time with the navbar and figuring out how to integrate it with my HTML and CSS files. I just did not understand this weeks work. It did not conceptually make sense to me. Even though I was following closely to the example code in the differing locations I could not make sense of why mine wasn't working. I did not understand any of the java script code and how that translated into working code.
