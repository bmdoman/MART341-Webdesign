1. I knew basically nothing before this class about HTML. I have actually really enjoyed learning about HTML. I was surprised how much I like it and I learned so much. I think for me the most difficult things to learn was just the amount of information in a short amount of time, and trying to remember all of the different things.

2. I am just excited to learn more about this. I am excited to build off my skills.

3. I think that some of the challenges with me are just figuring out what to code. What subject to code.
