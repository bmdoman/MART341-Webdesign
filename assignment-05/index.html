<p>This is a true story is about a young girl, ages 6-12, in Poland in the 1940s who gets put in a Nazi Ghetto. The Story goes though her life trying to survive the unthinkable. She ends up as one of the 12 remaining children in that ghetto. </p> <p>This was one of my favorite chapter books growing up. I read this book at a very formative part of my childhood, this book expanded my mind to think about a lot of different points in history. This grew my love of history as well, the main character in this book was about my age when I started reading the book.</p>
