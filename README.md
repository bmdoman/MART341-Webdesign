Repository for my Intro to Web Design Homework

Week 2: I created a repository on GitHub and made different files. I also learned how to properly name things so that they can be read by a computer. I created a responce.txt to answer all of the homework questions and made screenshots of the homework. For me some of the challenges was trying to make sure that I read the directions close enough and didn't miss anything. I am suprised at how easily I got this.
