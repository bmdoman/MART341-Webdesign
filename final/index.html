            I am a seasoned vertren of the summer camp. From fourth grade on into high school camp left a special place in my heart. I would certainly not be the person I am today without it. After going to camp all of my life and then working at one in college I wanted to know other peoples experiences with camps all across the country. This was a place where people could tell their stories in an open space that is free from judgement. With this podcast I get to talk to people about the places that most fall in love with. Camp is such a special place for people and I wanted to bring light to the people that make camp such a special place.

            When I started this podcast I was a senior in high school. This was an assignment I needed to complete for my class, and when I had a lot of time on my hands during 2020 with COVID I decided to start it back up again. So far I have 11 episodes out with people from five different camps across the US. I plan on exapanding this podcast to include so many different types of camp experiences. Sharing peoples stories about their time at camp is super important to me and I hope to do it for a long time. If you would like to learn more about camp you can go to the <a href= “https://www.acacamps.org/”> American Camp Association</a>. You can also go listen to the Confessions of a Camp Counselor Podcast finding it anywhere you get your podcasts or by going to <a href="https://anchor.fm/bailee-doman"> Anchor</a> to find out more information.
