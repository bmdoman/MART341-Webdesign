1. I learned so much this semester. I didn't know really anything about coding. Coding was something that I wanted to learn a while back but thought was to hard to lean by myself. I really liked learning the basics. Once I got those everything else was pretty easy to look up.

2. I learned a bit of new things about web design. I liked learning about colors. I think that I would really like to learn more about colors and how to make a really nice website out of different color pallets.

3. I could not figure out for a while how to make my navbar go above my content. It was because I was missing a closing </nav>. It took a good 40 minutes to figure out what I had wrong.
