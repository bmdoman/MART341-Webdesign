      Hi, my name is Bailee Doman and I am just about to be a college graduate with a B.S in Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management. Thoughtout my college career I have done many things. I went on a lot of adventures around the United States, backpacked a great deal, and went on river trips.

      In college I held multiple jobs along with getting my residency in Montana during my sophomore and junior year of college. I worked for the Adams Center and the Rocky Mountain Research Center on campus. I worked at a Flathead Lutheran Bible Camp as a camp hand and counselor for two summers gathering a love for the outdoors. I also worked for Old Chicago and Zoo Town Surfers. During the summer of my junior year I started my own housecleaning and odd jobs business that ran really well until COVID hit.

      Along with all of the jobs I did a lot of traveling locally in Montana and across the United States. I did road trips, backpacking, canoeing, and much more. These trips taught me so much about myself and what my passions are in life. I went on four backpacking trips last summer, as well as going to 12 different National Parks all across the west.

      During school I did a few extracurriculars. My freshman and sophomore year of college I was in the Grizzly Marching Band and absolutly loved it. This gave me a community throughtout college and made me some of my best friends. Along with the Grizzly Marching Band, I also did pep band for the basketball season. This gave me the unique oppertunity to go to Kansas for the NCAA tournament back in 2018. This was a really unique experince and is one of my top favorite college memories. Aside from band, I was a Freshman Wilderness Experiece leader. This game me the opportunity to really fall in love with guiding trips. I learned so much about myself and that guiding trips is something I want to do for the rest of my life.
