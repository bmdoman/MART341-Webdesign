1. A system font is fonts that are specific to a certain system (Mac vs Windows). A web font is fonts that are not necessarily specific to a certain server but rather fonts that you can find on the web. The web-safe fonts are the fonts that are on both Mac and Windows and are free for any system to access.

2. The importance of having a fallback font is so that if the primary font fails there is a font that is similar to it to fall back on.

3. I found it a little difficult to deal with the fonts and figure out what fonts would work on my page the best. I Really liked how things are turning out though.
